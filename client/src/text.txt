Introduction to React Hooks
In this blog, I'll be explaining some of the most frequently used hooks in react.

useState()
We have something called "State" in React which are just like "const" but they are being continuously monitored by React Virtual DOM for changes.

As we update the state of a component, React automatically re-renders the component with updated state.

useEffect()
This is a method in react which runs every-time the component is rendered. we can explicitly program this function to run every time something changes in the Application.

useRef()
As we update the state of a component, React automatically re-renders the component with updated state.
